    <h3>The Ethics Issues of “The Princess BriBe: An Inconceivable Musical Parody”</h3>
    <h4>By Ingrid Etienne</h4>
    <p>
        Celebrating another year performing Ethics Follies at the at The Charline McCombs Empire Theatre, our local ACC Chapter presents <cite>The Princess BriBe: An Inconceivable Musical Parody</cite>, a parody of the 1987 movie <cite>The Princess Bride</cite> and the 1973 novel of the same name.
    </p>
    <p>
        The parody tells the story of Mary Gold and Winsome, a love-struck couple who met at Ye Old Law School of St. Marieth in the Kingdom of Florin.  Winsome and Mary Gold were deeply in love and just as deeply devoted to legal ethics.  They both agreed to take jobs beginning in the fall with a non-profit in the Kingdom of Florin, but Winsome accepted a dangerous opportunity to travel overseas that summer to help draft a constitution for a newly forming democracy in The Divided States of Hysteria. Sadly, Winsome never reached his destination. His ship was attacked by a counter insurgency group led by the Dread Pirate Rat Breath, who never left captives alive.  Murder on the high seas, grief, and wanting what is best for the Kingdom of Florin, led Mary Gold down a trail of bad decisions (ethical and otherwise) towards the “Florin Flail,” Prince D. HumptyDump, who was known to mercilessly whip his opponents in trial.  Love and legal ethics led Winsome on an adventure with friends to rescue Mary Gold, his true love, from the evil and ethics-violating Prince D. HumptyDump.  The parody preserves the novel's narrative style by presenting the story as a book being read by a grandfather to his sick granddaughter.

        The parody’s message is primarily focused on the ethical baseline of following the American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct (the “Model Rules”).  The parody also reflects the Texas Lawyer’s Creed that requires more than merely avoiding the violation of laws and rules (including the Model Rules).  Additionally, as licensed attorneys, our professionalism requires us to also comply with business ethics issues, even if those issues aren’t specifically referenced in the Model Rules or the Texas Lawyer’s Creed.   For example, Mary Gold's entire decision to take the bribe is a business ethics issue, even if it doesn't have a specific rule in the Model Rules. Similarly, Prince HumptyDump is always bending or breaking the guidance provided in the Texas Lawyer's Creed. As a result, both get themselves (and their firms) into hot water.

        Below is a summary of the primary Model Rules reflected in the show.  Enjoy!
    </p>

        The parody starts by introducing Mary Gold and Winsome as they worked on the next edition of their law school’s journal.  They were addressing the Florin Bar Association’s new flat ban against a lawyer having sexual relations with a client after the legal representation begins. While many jurisdictions have adopted this ban, a few others adopted a modified approach, finding that a sexual relationship with a client creates a rebuttable presumption of unethical conduct when it causes the lawyer to render <em>incompetent</em> services.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <span class="rule-cite">Model Rule 1.8(j): Client-Lawyer Relationship: Sexual Relations.</span>
        <span>The Model Rules state that A lawyer shall not have sexual relations with a client unless a consensual sexual relationship existed between them when the client-lawyer relationship commenced. </span>
    </blockquote>

        After graduation and news of Winsome’s death, Mary Gold is representing her Kingdom of Florin against the Kingdom of Guilder.  Mary Gold is faced with and struggles with the proposition of taking a bribe from opposing counsel, Prince HumptyDump, to throw the trial.  Mary Gold knows that she has a duty to inform the authorities that HumptyDump is committing a violation of the Model Rules, raising a substantial question as to his honesty, trustworthiness and fitness as a lawyer. But, if she keeps quiet, and accepts his bribe, then Florin would win the trial and jobs would be saved.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <span class="rule-cite">Model Rule 8.3(a) : Reporting Professional Misconduct.</span>
        <span>The Model Rules state that a lawyer who knows that another lawyer has committed a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct that raises a substantial question as to that lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects, shall inform the appropriate professional authority.</span>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        In a snarky battle of wits duel between the Man in Black and Fettucini over ethics rules the Man in Black poses a question that addresses the issue of whether the appellate attorney from the same small firm as the trial lawyer can handle the appeal? a) Yes, if the client consents to the potential conflict of interest; b) Yes, because there is no conflict of interest if the appellate attorney’s own conduct is not in question; or c) No, because under the legal standard for ineffective assistance of counsel, the appeal would potentially require the attorney to disparage the representation of his own colleague as being unreasonably poor.  The answer is “c,” because under the legal standard for ineffective assistance of counsel, the appeal would potentially require the attorney to disparage the representation of his own colleague as being unreasonably poor in violation of Model Rule 1.10.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the story progresses, we continue to see examples Prince HumptyDump’s professional misconduct and continued false statements.  In one scene Prince HumptyDump promises to return Winsome to his ship, even though he has no intention of returning him.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <span class="rule-cite">Model Rule 8.4(c): Misconduct.</span>
        <span>It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to: …. (c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.</span>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        In another scene, we learn how Prince HumptyDump made false statements concerning a judge’s qualifications and integrity.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <span class="rule-cite">Model Rule 8.2: Judicial & Legal Officials.</span>
        <span>(a) A lawyer shall not make a statement that the lawyer knows to be false or with reckless disregard as to its truth or falsity concerning the qualifications or integrity of a judge, adjudicatory officer or public legal officer, or of a candidate for election or appointment to judicial or legal office.</span>
    </blockquote>
    As the story continues, we continue to learn more about professional misconduct under <cite>Model Rule 8.4</cite>.
    <p>
        <span class="rule-cite">Model Rule 8.4:</span>
        <span>It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to: …. (b) commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects. (c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        As the story nears the end, we return to the initial trial between the Kingdom of Florin against the Kingdom of Guilder and learn about evidence that would vindicate the Kingdom of Florin at trial.  HumptyDump had been violating <cite>Model Rule 3.4</cite> by unlawfully obstructing access to evidence and concealing documents that had evidentiary value.  We also learn about notes describing HumptyDump’s strategy of making frivolous discovery requests and failing to make reasonably diligent efforts to comply with Mary Gold’s legally proper discovery requests, also in violation of that same rule!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <span class="rule-cite">Model Rule 3.4 (a), (d) and (e): Fairness to Opposing Party & Counsel.</span>
        <span>The Model Rules state that a lawyer shall not: (a) unlawfully obstruct another party's access to evidence or unlawfully alter, destroy or conceal a document or other material having potential evidentiary value. A lawyer shall not counsel or assist another person to do any such act; …. (d) in pretrial procedure, make a frivolous discovery request or fail to make reasonably diligent effort to comply with a legally proper discovery request by an opposing party; (e) in trial, allude to any matter that the lawyer does not reasonably believe is relevant or that will not be supported by admissible evidence, assert personal knowledge of facts in issue except when testifying as a witness, or state a personal opinion as to the justness of a cause, the credibility of a witness, the culpability of a civil litigant or the guilt or innocence of an accused.</span>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        As with any good story, our parody ends with love and ethics.  Mary Gold and Winsome are finally able to marry.  Recognizing that good ethics is good for business, the happy couple and their three friends start a new law firm, making ethics and integrity the central focus of their practices, and caring genuinely for each other, their clients and their community.
