  <h3 class="text-wall">Mission Statement</h3>
  <p class="text-wall">
    The South/Central Texas Chapter of the Association of Corporate Counsel (&ldquo;ACC&rdquo;) made a commitment in 1997 to facilitate the open discussion of legal and business ethics issues among its members on an annual basis at an ethics conference. <em>Ethics Follies</em>&reg; was created in 2006 with the additional goal of involving other professionals in the creative process of creating both an entertaining and educational presentation. In 2008, ACC recognized the increasing role of in-house attorneys in both monitoring and participating in corporate ethics and responsibility efforts, and corporate executives and outside lawyers were encouraged to attend Ethics Follies with their legal counsel and accountants. The heightened awareness of these business and legal ethics issues increases our membership's ability to provide valuable counsel and educate our clients in the Central and South Texas business community. In 2009, the Lee Cusenbary Ethical Life Awards will recognize a law firm or solo practitioner and an in-house law department that consistently demonstrates a commitment to ethical business and legal practices. The net proceeds of the Follies are donated to the Community Justice Program.

    Ethics Follies is the creation of The Association of Corporate Counsel, South/Central Texas Chapter and is written and directed by former ACC Chapter President Lee Cusenbary with help from many of the ACC members. The educational production is now in its eleventh year of entertaining and educating with musical parodies of popular Broadway shows, weaving into the plotlines relevant rules of ethical conduct and real life examples of the harm caused by unethical behavior by attorneys and their clients. The high-energy and fast-paced exchange among characters creates an engaging &ldquo;edutainment&rdquo; experience. Many attendees can recall the ethics issues they have seen acted out better than remembering an abstract concept that was read in a list of rules. Ethics Follies has been seen by more than 20,000 attorneys and executive through live shows, webcasts, and DVD viewings. The ethics program has been featured by national conferences such as the International Association of Corporate Counsel, the National Women Trial Lawyers, and the American Bar Association and has provided training to state and local bar associations such as the Texas State Bar Conference, the San Francisco Bar Association and the San Antonio Bar Association. Ethics Follies has also trained Walmart&rsquo;s eight hundred outside legal counsel at the Super Conference in Bentonville, Arkansas.
